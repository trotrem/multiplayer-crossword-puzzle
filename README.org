* Multiplayer Crossword Game
This is part of a 5 people group project for school that included another game (3D racing game in the browser using THREE.js)
Most of the work on the crossword part was done by me and but I only helped on the other one.
I decided to only upload the crossword for that reason.

** Technologies used:
*** Angular for the frontend
*** ExpressJS for the backend
*** MongoDB for persistence
*** Socket.IO for communication

10 grids of each difficulty are persisted in the database to be able to start playing faster.
A new crossword grid is generated every time someone starts a new game ant it replaces the last grid used in the DB.

To start, run npm install and npm start in the client and server folders
